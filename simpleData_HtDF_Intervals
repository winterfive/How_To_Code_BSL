;; MIXED DATA
;; countdown-starter.rkt

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Consider designing the system for controlling a New Year's Eve
; display. Design a data definition to represent the current state 
; of the countdown, which falls into one of three categories: 
; 
;  - not yet started
;  - from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight
;  - complete (Happy New Year!)
; 


;; Countdown is one of:
;; - false
;; - Int [1, 10]    ; mixed data: boolean, number, string
;; - "complete"
;; interp.
;;    false       means countdown hasn't started
;;    Int[1,10]   means countdown has started and seconds left
;;    "complete"  means countdown is done
(define CD1 false)
(define CD2 10)
(define CD3 1)
(define CD4 "complete")

(define (fn-for-countdown c)
  (cond [(false? c) (...)]
        [(number? c) (... c)]  ; handles multiple data types, just a guard
        [else (...)]))

;; Template rules used:
;; - one of: 3 cases
;; - atomic distinct: false
;; - atomic non-distinct: Int [1, 10]
;; - atomic distinct: "complete"
